              information your computer automatically provides to us and which
              cannot be tied back to you as a specific individual. Examples
              include referral data (the websites you visited just before and
              just after our site), the pages viewed, time spent at our website,

              that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you
              access the Internet. For example, when you request a page from one
              of our sites, our servers log your IP address to create aggregate
              reports on user demographics and traffic patterns and for purposes
              of system administration. Log Files. Every time you request or
              download a file from the website, GrassItUp Living may store data
              about these events and your IP address in a log file. GrassItUp
              Living may use this information to analyze trends, administer the
              website, track users’ movements, and gather broad demographic
              information for aggregate use or for other business purposes. We
              also receive personal information from third parties and other
              sources.
